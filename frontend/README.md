# GPUBROKER Frontend

This is a Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS frontend scaffold for the GPUBROKER UI based on the `UI_UX_SPECIFICATIONS.md` document.

Quick start:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:${PORT_FRONTEND:-28030} to see the dashboard and pages. The scaffold includes:
- Header/navigation
- Login page
- Marketplace (provider grid + filter sidebar)
- Analytics and AI assistant stub pages
- Basic design tokens and Tailwind setup

Next steps: wire pages to real backend APIs and replace placeholder/mock content with live data.
