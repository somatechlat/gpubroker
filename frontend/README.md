# GPUBROKER Frontend

This is a Vite + Lit + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS frontend for the GPUBROKER UI based on the `UI_UX_SPECIFICATIONS.md` document.

Quick start:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to see the dashboard and pages. The scaffold includes:
- Header/navigation
- Login page
- Marketplace (provider grid + filter sidebar)
- Settings for provider integrations
- Basic design tokens and Tailwind setup

Next steps: extend coverage for analytics and AI assistant flows once backend endpoints are ready.
