# OLD Architecture Imports Analysis
# Generated: 2026-01-08
# Status: REMOVE ALL - NO BACKUP NEEDED

## CATEGORY 1: Django Configuration (CRITICAL - UPDATE FIRST)
backend/gpubroker/gpubroker/asgi.py
  - from apps.websocket_gateway.routing import websocket_urlpatterns
  → REPLACE WITH: from gpubrokerpod.gpubrokerapp.apps.websocket_gateway.routing import websocket_urlpatterns

## CATEGORY 2: Test Files (UPDATE AFTER SETTINGS)
backend/gpubroker/tests/test_providers.py
  - from apps.providers.adapters.registry import ProviderRegistry
  - from apps.providers.adapters.base import BaseProviderAdapter, ProviderOffer
  - from apps.providers.models import Provider, GPUOffer
  - from apps.providers.services import fetch_offers_from_adapters
  → DELETE FILE (tests OLD architecture that will be removed)

backend/gpubroker/tests/test_providers_simple.py
  - from apps.providers.adapters.registry import ProviderRegistry
  - from apps.providers.adapters.base import BaseProviderAdapter, ProviderOffer
  - from apps.providers.models import Provider, GPUOffer
  - from apps.providers.services import fetch_offers_from_adapters
  → DELETE FILE (tests OLD architecture that will be removed)

backend/gpubroker/tests/test_provider_data.py
  - from apps.providers.adapters.registry import ProviderRegistry
  - from apps.providers.adapters.base import ProviderOffer
  → DELETE FILE (tests OLD architecture that will be removed)

backend/gpubroker/tests/test_live_analysis.py
  - from apps.providers.adapters.registry import ProviderRegistry
  → DELETE FILE (tests OLD architecture that will be removed)

backend/gpubroker/tests/test_final_integration.py
  - from apps.providers.adapters.registry import ProviderRegistry
  → DELETE FILE (tests OLD architecture that will be removed)

backend/gpubroker/tests/test_real_data.py
  - from apps.providers.adapters.registry import ProviderRegistry
  - from apps.providers.adapters.base import ProviderOffer
  → DELETE FILE (tests OLD architecture that will be removed)

## CATEGORY 3: OLD Architecture Internal Files (WILL BE DELETED WITH DIRECTORY)
backend/gpubroker/apps/kpi/tests.py
backend/gpubroker/apps/kpi/services.py
backend/gpubroker/apps/auth_app/tests.py
backend/gpubroker/apps/auth_app/services/jwt_service.py
backend/gpubroker/apps/auth_app/api/auth.py
backend/gpubroker/apps/auth_app/auth.py
backend/gpubroker/apps/ai_assistant/tests.py
backend/gpubroker/apps/providers/tests.py
backend/gpubroker/apps/providers/api.py
backend/gpubroker/apps/providers/services.py
backend/gpubroker/apps/security/monitoring.py
  → ALL DELETED when backend/gpubroker/apps/ directory is removed

## SUMMARY
- Total OLD imports found: 8 files outside OLD architecture
- Django config files: 1 (asgi.py) - UPDATE
- Test files: 6 - DELETE (test OLD architecture)
- OLD architecture internal: ~11 files - DELETE WITH DIRECTORY

## EXECUTION PLAN
1. Update Django settings (base.py) - remove OLD apps, add POD SaaS apps
2. Update ASGI config (asgi.py) - change websocket import
3. Delete test files that test OLD architecture
4. Remove entire backend/gpubroker/apps/ directory
5. Verify no OLD imports remain
